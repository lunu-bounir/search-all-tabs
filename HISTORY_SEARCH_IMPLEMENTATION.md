# Browser History Search Implementation

## Overview

The search-all-tabs extension has been enhanced to search through browser history in addition to active tabs, providing a comprehensive search experience across all your browsing activity.

## New Features

### 1. Browser History Integration
- **Search through browser history**: In addition to searching active tabs, the extension can now index and search pages from your browser history
- **Configurable time range**: Search history from the last 1-365 days (default: 7 days)
- **Adjustable limits**: Configure how many history items to index (100-10,000, default: 1000)
- **Intelligent content fetching**: Automatically fetches page content for history items when needed

### 2. Enhanced User Interface
- **Visual distinction**: History items are marked with a clock icon (ðŸ•’) and blue border
- **Type indicators**: Results show "history" tag for items from browser history vs active tabs
- **Smart interactions**: 
  - History items open in new tabs when clicked
  - Tab operations (group/close) automatically exclude history items
  - Keyboard shortcuts respect history vs tab distinction

### 3. Configuration Options
Navigate to the extension's Options page to configure:
- **Enable Browser History Search**: Toggle history search on/off
- **History Days**: Number of days to search back (1-365)
- **Max Results**: Maximum number of history items to index (100-10,000)

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Changes

1. **Enhanced Indexer Class** (`data/popup/indexer.js`):
   - `queryHistory()`: Queries browser history using chrome.history API
   - `inspectHistory()`: Fetches content for history items via HTTP requests
   - Parallel processing of both tabs and history items

2. **Updated Permissions** (`manifest.json`):
   - Added `"history"` permission for browser history access

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Options page with history configuration controls
   - Visual indicators for history items in search results
   - Smart handling of history items in tab operations

4. **Search Results Processing**:
   - History items use tabId = -1 to distinguish from active tabs
   - Separate handling for opening history items vs focusing active tabs
   - Exclusion of history items from tab management operations

### Data Flow

```
User Search Query
     â†“
Indexer.query() â†’ Active Tabs (chrome.tabs API)
     +
Indexer.queryHistory() â†’ Browser History (chrome.history API)
     â†“
Content Processing:
- Active tabs â†’ Content script injection
- History items â†’ HTTP fetch + DOM parsing
     â†“
Xapian Database Indexing
     â†“
Search Results with visual distinction
```

### Storage Structure

History items are stored with additional metadata:
- `visitCount`: Number of times page was visited
- `lastVisitTime`: Timestamp of last visit
- `typedCount`: Number of times URL was typed
- `isHistory`: Boolean flag marking history items

## Usage Examples

### Basic History Search
1. Open extension options
2. Check "Enable Browser History Search"
3. Set desired time range (e.g., 30 days)
4. Save options
5. Search as normal - results will include both active tabs and history

### Advanced Configuration
- **For heavy browsing**: Increase max results to 5000+ for comprehensive history
- **For performance**: Reduce history days to 3-7 for faster indexing
- **For privacy**: Keep history search disabled and use only active tabs

## Performance Considerations

- **Initial indexing**: First-time history indexing may take several minutes depending on history size
- **Network usage**: History items require HTTP requests to fetch content
- **Storage**: History content is cached locally to avoid re-fetching
- **Incremental updates**: Only new/changed items are re-indexed

## Privacy & Security

- **Local processing**: All history content is processed and stored locally
- **No external servers**: History data never leaves your device
- **User control**: History search can be completely disabled
- **Selective indexing**: Respects existing exclusion patterns

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support with manifest v3
- **Firefox**: Supported (requires manual permission grant)
- **Edge**: Compatible (Chromium-based)

## Installation Steps (Local Development)

If you have the enhanced extension folder locally, follow these steps to install it:

### Chrome Installation

1. **Open Chrome Extension Management**:
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
   - OR click the three-dot menu â†’ More tools â†’ Extensions

2. **Enable Developer Mode**:
   - Toggle "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner

3. **Load the Extension**:
   - Click "Load unpacked" button
   - Navigate to and select the `search-all-tabs/v3.new/` folder
   - Click "Select Folder"

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - The extension should appear in your extensions list
   - Pin it to your toolbar for easy access
   - You should see the Search all Tabs icon in your browser toolbar

### Firefox Installation

1. **Open Firefox Add-ons Manager**:
   - Navigate to `about:debugging` in Firefox
   - Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar

2. **Load Temporary Add-on**:
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
   - Navigate to `search-all-tabs/v3.new/`
   - Select the `manifest.json` file
   - Click "Open"

3. **Grant Additional Permissions** (Firefox-specific):
   - The extension may require manual permission grants
   - Follow any permission prompts that appear
   - You may need to enable additional permissions in Firefox settings

### Initial Setup

After installation in either browser:

1. **Configure History Search** (Optional but Recommended):
   - Right-click the extension icon â†’ Options
   - OR go to extension management and click "Options"
   - Check "Enable Browser History Search"
   - Set your preferred time range (e.g., 30 days)
   - Set max results (e.g., 2000 for comprehensive search)
   - Click "Save Options"

2. **Test the Extension**:
   - Click the extension icon to open the search interface
   - Try searching for something you know is in your tabs or history
   - Verify both active tabs and history items appear in results

3. **Permission Grants** (If Prompted):
   - Grant "tabs" permission for full tab management features
   - Grant "history" permission for browser history search
   - Grant "unlimited storage" for better performance with large datasets

### Troubleshooting

**Extension Not Loading**:
- Ensure you're selecting the correct folder (`v3.new/` not the parent folder)
- Check browser console for any error messages
- Verify all files are present in the folder

**History Search Not Working**:
- Confirm history permission was granted
- Check that "Enable Browser History Search" is checked in options
- Try reducing the time range if initial indexing is slow

**Performance Issues**:
- Reduce "Max Results" in options (try 1000 instead of higher values)
- Reduce "History Days" to a smaller range (try 7 days initially)
- Clear browser cache and restart the browser

### File Structure Verification

Ensure your local folder contains these key files:
```
search-all-tabs/v3.new/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json (with "history" permission)
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ popup/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js (enhanced with history support)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ indexer.js (enhanced with history methods)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ options/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (with history configuration UI)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js (with history settings handlers)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ xapian/ (search engine files)
â””â”€â”€ worker.js (background service worker)
```

## Migration Notes

Existing users can enable history search without losing current tab search functionality. The feature is opt-in and disabled by default.
